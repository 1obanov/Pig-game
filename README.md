# The Pig Game
Fun 2 player game with the dices in the center! Easy-to-play game written in JavaScript while learning the course on Udemy.

## Rules of the game
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a two dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 of any of dices, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- Also you can choose your own winning score if you want, just write the number in the 'FINAL SCORE' field
